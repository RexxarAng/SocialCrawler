                    <td>Taking a moment to appreciate the works of Web Designers this Web Designer Day! A well-made website or digital service with a consistent user experience helps users to navigate with ease and have a pleasant experience.With the greater adoption of digital services in Singapore, there is an increasing need to ensure the design quality of these services. This is why we developed the Singapore Government Design System (SGDS)! It consists of a collection of open-source, front-end components to build and customise websites. There is also a collection of frameworks, best practices and guidelines for developers, designers and writers. The SGDS was designed to to help agencies implement digital services faster and meet the goals of being accessible and easy to use!

A11y Week, organised by our Accessibility Enabling Team (A11y Team) in our Government Digital Services Division, is an annual learning festival for all public officers to explore what it means to design accessible and inclusive digital services for everyone in Singapore.Public officers from over 80 agencies attended a series of educational physical workshops and virtual talks that put the spotlight on different forms of non-standard communication. In the workshops, participants got to experience the impact of inaccessible digital services first-hand, learned how to scan their agency websites for accessibility issues, and explored how we can all take actionable steps to support Persons with Disabilities through our work and in our daily lives.

⁣
A well-made website or digital service with a consistent user experience helps user to navigate with ease and have a pleasant experience.⁣
⁣
This is why we developed the Singapore Government Design System (SGDS)! It consists of a collection of open-source, front-end components to build and customise websites. There is also a collection of frameworks, best practices and guidelines for developers, designers and writers. The SGDS was designed to help agencies to implement digital services faster and meet the goals of being accessible and easy to use!⁣

A11y Week, organised by our Accessibility Enabling Team (A11y Team) in our Government Digital Services Division, is an annual learning festival for all public officers to explore what it means to design accessible and inclusive digital services for everyone in Singapore.

Public officers from over 80 agencies attended a series of educational physical workshops and virtual talks that put the spotlight on different forms of non-standard communication. In the workshops, participants got to experience the impact of inaccessible digital services first-hand, learned how to scan their agency websites for accessibility issues, and explored how we can all take actionable steps to support Persons with Disabilities through our work and in our daily lives.
