"I was a huge fan of Myinfo even before joining the team. I love how it pre-fills forms (especially credit card applications), allowing me to avoid the hassle of digging up the right documents for submission.

A well-made website or digital service with a consistent user experience helps user to navigate with ease and have a pleasant experience.‚Å£
‚Å£
This is why we developed the Singapore Government Design System (SGDS)! It consists of a collection of open-source, front-end components to build and customise websites. There is also a collection of frameworks, best practices and guidelines for developers, designers and writers. The SGDS was designed to help agencies to implement digital services faster and meet the goals of being accessible and easy to use!‚Å£

A well-made website or digital service with a consistent user experience helps users to navigate with ease and have a pleasant experience.With the greater adoption of digital services in Singapore, there is an increasing need to ensure the design quality of these services. This is why we developed the Singapore Government Design System (SGDS)! It consists of a collection of open-source, front-end components to build and customise websites. There is also a collection of frameworks, best practices and guidelines for developers, designers and writers. The SGDS was designed to to help agencies implement digital services faster and meet the goals of being accessible and easy to use!
